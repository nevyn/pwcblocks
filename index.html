		<h2><span class="headno">0</span><a name="introduction" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
	In Mac OS X 10.6, Apple introduced a syntax and runtime for using blocks (more commonly known as closures)
	in C and Objective-C. These were both later back-ported to Mac OS X 10.5 and the iPhone by Plausible Labs.
	However, there is very little documentation on blocks; even Apple's documentation that come with 10.6
	is very vague on what memory management rules apply. I hope that you can avoid all the trial-and-error
	that I went through with the help of this guide.
</p>

<p>
	This is sort of a bottom-up tutorial, going from the absolute basics in C, and moving towards higher
	abstractions in Objective-C. I doubt that reading just the Objective-C part will do you much good;
	at least, read the chapter on <a href="#cblocks-memory">memory management in C</a> first.

	<h2><span class="headno">1</span><a name="whatareblocks" href="#whatareblocks">What are Blocks?</a></h2>
		<p>
			Blocks are like functions, but written inline with the rest of your code, <em>inside</em> other functions. They are also
			called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)" title="Closure (computer science) - Wikipedia,
			the free encyclopedia">closures</a>, because they <em>close</em> around variables in your scope. (They can also be called
			lambdas). Let me demonstrate what this means:
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<a class="codedownload" href="counter.zip">counter.zip</a>
			<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;Block.h&gt;
typedef int (^IntBlock)();

IntBlock counter(int start, int increment) {
	__block int i = start;
	
	return Block_copy( ^ {
		int ret = i;
		i += increment;
		return ret;
	});
	
}

int main() {
	IntBlock mycounter = counter(5, 2);
	printf("First call: %d\n", mycounter());
	printf("Second call: %d\n", mycounter());
	printf("Third call: %d\n", mycounter());
	
	Block_release(mycounter);
	
	return 0;
}
/* Output:
	First call: 5
	Second call: 7
	Third call: 9
*/
			</code></pre>
		</div>
		
	<p>
		<code>counter</code> is an ordinary C function that returns one of these fabled <em>blocks</em>. When you have
		a reference to one, you can <em>call</em> it, just as if it was a function pointer. The difference is that the
		block can use the variables in <code>counter</code> <em>even after the call to that function has returned!</em>
		The variables <code>i</code> and <code>increment</code> have become a part of the state of the block
		<code>mycounter</code>. I will go into more detail of how each part of this example works in 
		<a href="#cblocks">chapter 4</a>.
	</p>
	
	





<h2><span class="headno">2</span><a name="whyuseblocks" href="#whyuseblocks">What are Blocks Good For?</a></h2>

	<p>
		<strong>In Ruby</strong>, they are used in place of many control structures. The standard
		<code>for</code> loop is replaced by an ordinary function taking a block:
	</p>

	<div class="codeblock">
		<pre><code>
[1, 2, 3, 4].each do |i|
	puts i
end
# outputs the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 on a line each
	</code></pre></div>

	<p>
		<code>each</code> is an ordinary function that takes a block: the block is the code between the 'do' and the
		'end'. This is much more powerful than one might think, because with the ability to write your own control
		structures, you no longer need to depend on the evolution of the language to make your code terse and readable.
		Functional programming has many such useful control structures, such as the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)"title="Map (higher-order function) - Wikipedia,
		the free encyclopedia"><code>map</code></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduce_(higher-order_function)"
		title="Fold (higher-order function) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"><code>reduce</code></a> functions; the
		first maps each value in a list to another value, while the second reduces a list of values to a single value
		(e g the sum of integers in the list). This is an entire topic in itself, and I encourage to learn more about
		functional programming on Wikipedia as I won't be covering that anymore here.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>In Erlang</strong>, they are used as a concurrency primitive together with the 'light-weight
		process', instead of the thread. This simple example looks through an array looking for a match, but each element is tested
		in its own separate process; each element being tested at the same time.
	</p>

		<div class="codeblock">
			<pre><code>some_function() ->
  lists:for_each([1, 2, 3, 4], fun(element) -&gt; % (1)
    spawn(fun -&gt; % (2)
      if
        element &gt; 1 andalso element &lt; 4 -&gt; % (3)
          io:format("Found a match: ~p!~n", [element]); % (4)
        true -&gt; true
      end
    end
  end),
  io:format("This line appears after the above statement, "
            "but still executes before the code in it."). % (5)

% Outputs:
% This line appears after the above statement, but still executes before the code in it.
% Found a match: 3!
% Found a match: 2!
% OR with the lines swapped in any order, depending on scheduling</code></pre></div>

	<p>
		Erlang looks weird to the uninitiated, so I'll step it through for you. On the line numbered (1),
		we define an array with four numbers as elements, and calls the function <code>lists:for_each</code>
		with that list as a first argument, and a block taking one argument as the second argument
		(just as the function <code>Enumerable#each</code> takes a block argument in the Ruby example above).
		The block begins at the <code>-&gt;</code> and goes on until the last <code>end</code>. All that first
		block does is it <code>spawn</code>s a new Erlang process (line (2)), again taking a block as an argument
		to do the actual test, but now THIS block (line (2) still) is executing concurrently, and thus the test
		on line (3) is done concurrently for all elements in the array.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>In Cocoa</strong>, they can be used in both these ways, and more; for example, they are
		good for callbacks and delayed execution. Examples of these uses can be found at <a href="#ref4">mikeash.com [4]</a>.
		Apple's main reason for introducing blocks in C is most likely because they are perfect
		building blocks for concurrency. You can read more about Apple's Grand Central Dispatch in
		<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.

<h2><span class="headno">4</span><a name="cblocks" href="#cblocks">Blocks in C</a></h2>
	<h3><a name="cblocks-usage" href="#cblocks-usage">Syntax and Usage</a></h3>
		<p>
			<b>Variables pointing to blocks</b> take on the exact same syntax as variables pointing to
			functions, except <code>*</code> is substituted for <code>^</code>. For example, this is a function
			pointer to a function taking an int and returning a float:
		</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock"><code>float (*myfuncptr)(int);</code></div>
		
		<p>
			and this is a block pointer to a block taking an int and returning a float:
		</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock"><code>float (^myblockptr)(int);</code></div>
	
		<p>
			As with function pointers, you'll likely want to typedef those types, as it can get relatively
			hairy otherwise. For example, a pointer to a block returning a block taking a block would be something
			like <code>void(^)(void) (^myblockptr)(void(^)())</code>, which is nigh impossible to read (and doesn't
			even compile, I'm not sure how that'd be done). A simple typedef later, and it's much simpler:
		</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>typedef void (^Block)();
Block (^myblockptr)(Block);</code></pre></div>
		
		<p>
			<b>Declaring blocks</b> themselves is where we get into the unknown, as it doesn't really look like C,
			although they resemble function declarations. Let's start with the basics:
		</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>myvar1 = ^ returntype (type arg1, type arg2, and so on) {
	block contents;
	like in a function;
	return returnvalue;
};</code></pre></div>

		<p>
			This defines a <em>block literal</em> (from after <code>=</code> to and including <code>}</code>),
			explicitly mentions its return type, an argument list, the block body, a return statement, and
			assigns this literal to the variable myvar1.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			A <em>literal</em> is a value that can be built at compile-time. An integer literal (The
			<code>3</code> in <code>int a = 3;</code>) and a string literal (The <code>"foobar"</code> in
			<code>const char *b = "foobar";</code>) are other examples of literals. The fact that a block
			declaration is a literal is important later when we get into memory management.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Finding a return statement in a block like this is vexing to some. Does it return from
			the enclosing function, you may ask? No, it returns a value that can be used by the caller
			of the block. See 'Calling blocks'. Note: If the block has multiple return statements,
			they must return the same type.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Finally, some parts of a block declaration are optional. These are:
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					The argument list. If the block takes no arguments, the argument list can be skipped entirely. Examples:
					<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>myblock1 = ^ int (void) { return 3; }; // may be written as:
myblock2 = ^ int { return 3; }
</code></pre></div>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					The return type. If the block has no return statement, void is assumed. If the block has a return
					statement, the return type is inferred from it. This means you can almost always just skip the
					return type from the declaration, except in cases where it might be ambiguous. Examples:
					
					<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>myblock3 = ^ void { printf("Hello.\n"); }; // may be written as:
myblock4 = ^ { printf("Hello.\n"); };

// Both succeed ONLY if myblock5 and myblock6 are of type int(^)(void)
myblock5 = ^ int { return 3; }; // can be written as:
myblock6 = ^ { return 3; };
					</code></pre></div>
				
				</li>
				
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>Calling blocks and returning values</b> is as easy with a function or a function pointer. If you take the
			value from calling the block, you will get the value returned with <code>return</code>. Example:
		</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>typedef int(^IntBlock)();
IntBlock threeBlock = ^ { 
	return 3;
};
int three = threeBlock();

// Return values work just as in C functions. return needs to be explicit! This is not Ruby.
IntBlock fourBlock = ^ {
	4;
};
// Yields on compile:
//  error: incompatible block pointer types initializing 'void (^)(void)', expected 'IntBlock'
// This is because we neither specified the return type, 
// nor provided a return statement, thus implying void return.

		</code></pre></div>
		
		
		<p>
			<b>Using variables in the closure scope</b> is very straight-forward if you're just reading them. Just use them,
			and they will be magically managed by your block. However, if you want to be able to modify the variable, it need to be
			prefixed by the <code>__block</code> storage qualifier. Let's make the counter from the first example go forwards AND
			backwards:
		</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock">
			<a class="codedownload" href="counter2.zip">counter2.zip</a>
			<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;Block.h&gt;

typedef int (^IntBlock)();
typedef struct {
	IntBlock forward;
	IntBlock backward;
} Counter;

Counter MakeCounter(int start, int increment) {
	Counter counter;

	__block int i = start;

	counter.forward = Block_copy( ^ {
		i += increment;
		return i;
	});
	counter.backward = Block_copy( ^ {
		i -= increment;
		return i;
	});

	return counter;

}

int main() {
	Counter counter = MakeCounter(5, 2);
	printf("Forward one: %d\n", counter.forward());
	printf("Forward one more: %d\n", counter.forward());
	printf("Backward one: %d\n", counter.backward());

	Block_release(counter.forward);
	Block_release(counter.backward);

	return 0;
}
/* Outputs:
Forward one: 7
Forward one more: 9
Backward one: 7
*/
		</code></pre></div>
			
		<p>
			Note how we in the blocks use increment without doing any work, yet reference it outside the MakeCounter function.
			However, we only <em>read</em> from it. We also use <code>i</code>, but we modify it from inside the blocks. Thus,
			we need the <code>__block</code> keyword with that variable.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			<b>Sending and taking blocks as arguments</b> is again like doing so with function pointers. The difference is that
			you can define your block inline, in the call.
		</p>
		
		<div class="codeblock">
			<a class="codedownload" href="blockarguments.zip">blockarguments.zip</a>
			<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;Block.h&gt;

void intforeach(int *array, unsigned count, void(^callback)(int))
{
	for(unsigned i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
		callback(array[i]);
}

int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
	int numbers[] = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33};
	
	intforeach(numbers, 6, ^ (int number) {
		printf("%c", number);
	});
	printf("\n");
	
	return 0;
}
/* Outputs:
Hello!
*/</code></pre></div>
		
		<p>Notice how we call intforeach with an inline block. (If you're wondering about the numbers: they are the ascii codes for the letters in the word "Hello!"), and how intforeach could have been an ordinary C function taking a function pointer and still be written the exact same way except for switching the <code>^</code> for a <code>*</code>.


<h3><a name="cblocks-memory" href="#cblocks-memory">Memory Management</a></h3>
	
	<p>
		What does 'memory management' in the context of blocks mean? It doesn't mean storage for the actual code.
		The code of the block is compiled and loaded into the binary like any other function. The memory a block
		requires is that of the variables it has closed around; that is, any variables the block references need
		to be copied into the block's private memory.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		So far, we have just assumed that the memory has somehow magically become part of the block,
		and will magically disappear. Unfortunately Apple haven't added a garbage collector to C,
		so that's not quite the case. However, to understand the following, you must have a basic
		understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation"
		title="Stack-based memory allocation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">stack</a>
		and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation"
		title="Dynamic memory allocation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">heap</a> memory,
		and how they differ.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		When you define a <em>block literal</em>, you create the storage for this literal <em>on the stack</em>.
		The variable pointing to this literal can still be considered a pointer, however. This means that
		the following code compiles, but does not work:
	</p>
	
	<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>typedef void(^Block)(void);

Block blockMaker() {
	int a = 3; // (1)
	Block block = ^ { // (2)
		return a;
	}
	return block; // (3)
}
int main() {
	Block block2 = blockMaker(); // (4)
	int b = block2(); // (5)
	return 0;
}
</code></pre></div>
	
	<p>
		This is basically what the code above does:
	</p>
	<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>Block blockMaker() {
	int a = 3; // (1)
	struct Block_literal_1 *block;
	struct Block_literal_1 blockStorage = ...; // (2)
	block = &amp;blockStorage; // (2b)
	return block; // (3)
}</code></pre></div>
	
	<p>
		At (1), the value <code>3</code> is allocated on the stack and named <code>a</code>, as expected.
		At (2) and the following block, the value of <code>a</code> is copied into the block literal. Then,
		also at (2) (2b in the second example), a pointer to the literal is in turn assigned to the variable <code>block</code>.
		If you think of Block as just a pointer type, and the assignment in (2) as taking the address of a literal,
		you might see why (3) is invalid, but we'll get to that.
	</p>
	<p>
		In (4), the variable <code>block2</code> gets a reference to the literal in (2). However, both
		the variables <code>a</code> and <code>block</code> (together with <code>block</code>s copy of
		the value in <code>a</code>) have now fallen off the stack, as
		<code>blockMaker</code> has returned. When we call <code>block2</code> in (5), we might
		segfault, get a corrupted value, or whatever â€” the behavior is undefined.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The same effect can be demonstrated without involving blocks:
	</p>

	<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>int * intMaker() {
	int a = 3; // (1)
	return &amp;a; // (2)
}
int main() {
	int *b = intMaker(); // (3)
	return 0;
}</code></pre></div>
	
	<p>
		<code>intMaker</code> returns a pointer to an object on the stack (1), which will disappear together with the
		rest of the state of the function call when <code>intMaker</code> returns (2).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		How do work around this problem? Simple â€” we move the block to the <em>heap</em>. The function
		<code>Block_copy()</code> takes a block pointer, and if it's a stack block, copies it to the
		heap, or if it's already a heap block, increases its retain count (like an immutable object
		in Cocoa would do). Exactly what happens is an implementation detail, but the thing to
		take away is that you should never return a block literal from a function, but rather
		a copy of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we're done with the block, just release it with <code>Block_release()</code>. Thus,
		the correct way to implement the blockMaker example is like so:
	</p>
	
	<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>typedef void(^Block)(void);

Block blockMaker() {
	int a = 3;
	Block block = ^ {
		return a;
	}
	return Block_copy(block); // (1)
}
int main() {
	Block block2 = blockMaker();
	int b = block2();
	Block_release(block2); // (2)
	
	return 0;
}
</code></pre></div>

	<p>
		Notice how we move the block to the heap in (1), and discard the block when we're done with it in (2).
		For anyone who has done Cocoa or CoreFoundation programming, this pattern should be familiar.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		(An aside: If you try to return a literal like so: <code>Block foo() { return ^ { printf("Fail") }; }</code>,
		the compiler will complain that you are trying to return a stack literal, which isn't possible.)
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Be careful! You don't have to return from a function for something to fall
		off the stack. The following example is equally invalid (<a href="#ref4">[2]</a> and <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>):
	</p>
	
	<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>typedef void(^BasicBlock)(void);
void someFunction() {
	BasicBlock block;
	if(condition)
		block = ^ { ... };
	else
		block = ^ { ... };
	...
}

// Basically equivalent of:
void someFunction() {
	BasicBlock block;
	if(condition) {
		struct Block_literal_1 blockStorage = ...;
		block = &amp;blockStorage;
	} // blockStorage falls off the stack here
	else 
	{
		struct Block_literal_1 blockStorage = ...;
		block = &amp;blockStorage;
	} // blockStorage falls off the stack here
	// and block thus points to non-existing/invalid memory
	...
}

// Correct:
void someFunction() {
	BasicBlock block;
	if(condition)
		block = Block_copy(^ { ... });
	else
		block = Block_copy(^ { ... });
	...
}

</code></pre></div>

<h2><span class="headno">5</span><a name="objcblocks" href="#cblocks">Blocks in Objective-C</a></h2>
	<p>
		The really weird and wonderful thing about blocks is that <strong>blocks are actually Objective-C objects</strong>.
		Even if you create them from a C++ library, the specification says that every block must
		have the memory layout of an Objective-C object. The runtime then adds Objective-C methods
		to them, which allow them to be stored in collections, used with properties, and just generally
		<em>work</em> wherever you'd expect. These methods are:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>-[Block copy]</code>: Exactly the same as <code>Block_copy()</code>. This will give you a block
				on the heap with an owning reference, just like calling <code>-[NSObject copy]</code> on any other
				object.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>-[Block retain]</code>: This one is a bit weird, and almost the single reason why
				I wrote this entire guide. This calls Block_retain(). However, the conventions for Objective-C
				objects say that retain MUST return the same instance that it was called with. This means
				that retain cannot call copy; I'll get to why this is really, really annoying.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>-[Block release]</code>: <a href="#cblocks-memory"><code>Block_release()</code></a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>-[Block autorelease]</code>: That's right, <b>blocks can be autoreleased</b>!
			</li>
			<li>
				â€¦ And blocks inherit from NSObject, so whatever is defined on it (including your categories!) <a href="#ref3">[4]</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Blocks in Objective-C have one more very important difference from blocks in C in handling
		variables that reference objects. All local objects are <strong>automatically retained as they
		are referenced!</strong> If you reference an instance variable from a block declared in a method,
		this retains self, as you're implicitly doing <code>self->theIvar</code>. An example is in order:
	</p>
	
	<div class="codeblock">
		<a class="codedownload" href="logmessage.zip">logmessage.zip</a>
		<pre><code>typedef void(^BasicBlock)(void);
@interface LogMessage : NSObject {
	NSString *logLevel;
}
@end
@implementation LogMessage
-(BasicBlock)printLater:(NSString*)someObject;
{
	return [[^ {
		NSLog(@"%@: %@", 
			logLevel,  // (1)
			someObject // (2)
		);
	} copy] autorelease]; // (3)
}
@end
</code></pre></div>
	
	<p>
		Here's a method that simply returns a block that lets you print the given string, prefixed by the object's log level.
		In (3), the block is copied, because <a href="#cblocks-memory">as you remember</a>, you can't return a block literal since it's on the stack.
		Still, we want to follow common Cocoa patterns and never return an owning reference from a method called neither
		<code>copy</code>, <code>retain</code> nor <code>alloc</code>. This gives us the idiom <code>[[^{} copy] autorelease]</code>,
		which is what you should always use when returning blocks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now, for the auto retaining magic, notice how we reference the argument object <code>someObject</code>
		in (2), and implicitly <code>self</code> in (1) (which really says <code>self->logLevel</code>).
		When the block is copied in (3), Block_copy notices that logLevel and someObject are objects,
		and retains them. When the block is released, it will free all its captured variables,
		and if they are objects, release them.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		With even <code>self</code> being retained, this is a very easy way to accidentally create
		reference cycles and thus memory leaks. What if you want to avoid this behavior? Just give the variable
		<code>__block</code> storage (Thanks to mikeash<a href="#ref3">[4]</a> for pointing this out). Example:
	</p>
	<div class="codeblock">
			<a class="codedownload" href="__blockself.zip">__blockself.zip</a>
		<pre><code>-(void)someMethod;
{
	__block TypeOfSelf *blockSelf = self;
	^ {
		// Because blockSelf is __block, the following reference
		// won't retain self:
		blockSelf->myIvar += 3;
	}
	...
}</code></pre></div>

	<p>
		Why does this work? Well, if the variable is __block, it can be changed from within a block.
		If it's an object pointer, this means <em>changing the object pointer itself, not the object</em>.
		If the block autoretains object pointers, what should happen if the pointer is changed,
		pointing to another object? The concept is so hairy that they chose the simplest solution: 
		__block storage objects simply aren't autoretained.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Finally, one more memory management gotcha before we move onto syntax. Remember that blocks are objects?
		And objects are automatically retained? Yes, that's right, blocks also automatically retain
		blocks they refer to! (<a href="http://nopaste.me/4308" title="Objective C nopaste.me">My research</a>.)
		This means that the following code will work fine:
	</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<pre><code>typedef void(^BasicBlock)(void);

// Returns a block that aborts the process
-(BasicBlock)doSomethingAsynchronous;
{
	BasicBlock cleanup = [[^{
		// Do some common cleanup needed in all cases
	} copy] autorelease];
	
	__block AsyncDownloader *downloader = [AsyncDownloader fetch:@"http://domain/some.file" options:$dict(
		@"success": [[^ {
			[downloader.dataValue writeToFile:@"some/path" atomically:NO];
			DisplayAlert(@"Download complete");
			cleanup();
		} copy] autorelease],
		@"failure": [[^ {
			DisplayAlert(@"Error: %@", downloader.error);
			cleanup();
		} copy] autorelease]
	)];
	
	return [[^ {
		[downloader abort];
		cleanup();
	} copy] autorelease];
}</code></pre></div>
	
	<p>
		Notice how <code>downloader</code> is declared <code>__block</code> â€” otherwise me referencing it
		in the callback blocks would retain it, and the downloader retains the blocks, thus creating a cycle.
		<a href="https://bitbucket.org/snej/myutilities/src/tip/CollectionUtils.h">$dict is a very handy macro</a>
		which creates a dictionary from key-value pairs (the NSDictionary constructor is too verbose for my taste).
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice how all three blocks reference the cleanup block: it is thus retained and properly memory managed
		until the referring blocks disappear.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This example also highlights a problem with stack block literals â€” collections, such as NSDictionary above,
		<code>retain</code>s its values, but <code>-[Block retain]</code> doesn't do anything on stack blocks!
		Thus, we must move the blocks to the heap before we can insert them into the dictionary.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In the syntax department, you might have two questions. How do I use non-typedef'd blocks as method arguments,
		and can I use them as properties? This example should make that clear:
	</p>
	
	<div class="codeblock">
		<a class="codedownload" href="propertyblocks.zip">propertyblocks.zip</a>
		<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
#import &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

@interface PredicateRunner : NSObject
{
	BOOL (^predicate)();
}
@property (copy) BOOL (^predicate)();
-(void)callTrueBlock:(void(^)())true_ falseBlock:(void(^)())false_;
@end

@implementation PredicateRunner
@synthesize predicate;
-(void)callTrueBlock:(void(^)())true_ falseBlock:(void(^)())false_;
{
	if(predicate())
		true_();
	else 
		false_();

}
-(void)dealloc;
{
	self.predicate = nil;
	[super dealloc];
}
@end



int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
	NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
	srandom(time(NULL));

	PredicateRunner *pr = [[PredicateRunner new] autorelease];
	pr.predicate = ^ BOOL {
		return random()%2;
	};
	[pr callTrueBlock:^ {NSLog(@"Yeah");} falseBlock:^ {NSLog(@"Nope");} ];

	[pool drain];
	return 0;
}</code></pre></div>

	<p>
		Typedefs will make that much easier to read, though.
